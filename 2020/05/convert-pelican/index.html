    <p>Moving this page over to using Pelican has been a long time coming. Though it might appear that this is a first post, this GitHub page has already seen a few&nbsp;iterations.</p>
<p>Sometime last year, after spending a lot of time reading programming books, I set out to write my first real program, simpai-spg, which was supposed to be a simple static page generator written in&nbsp;python3. </p>
<p>The primary motivation for writing it was that I had been working on a design <a href="../../../other/virulence.html">virulence.css</a>, which was a fork of <a href="https://hale.su/serenity.html">serenity.scss</a>, and ultimately, I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to easily use it as a&nbsp;theme.</p>
<p>At the time, I didn&#8217;t know what a templating engine was, let alone how to write jinja2. I suppose using Pelican seemed a lot more complicated to me than it needed to be. I felt like, &#8220;I already know <span class="caps">HTML</span>, I already know <span class="caps">CSS</span>, why do I have to learn this program to abstract away from it as much as&nbsp;possible?&#8221;</p>
<h3>Failings of&nbsp;Simpai</h3>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t as simple to assemble my content the way I imagined it would be. And though the first version worked, it truly was a &#8220;simple&#8221; page generator. It took the text from your post and inserted it into a page. It took every post and listed it with articles. The pagination worked in the end. And it was all strung together with <code>string.Template</code>.</p>
<p>The primary problem with the program was that&#8230; it could only generate one post at a time through an executable <code>new_post.py</code>, after which point, it would never be able to generate the page again. After that point, I started saving the data into json to solve this problem, but it was clearly going to become a very not-maintainable project upon getting&nbsp;bigger.</p>
<p>The end result of building simpai-spg was that, the moment I wanted to add some feature to my site design, the entire thing broke. I planned a new version each time I changed the design, and each time, the automated process of building the site broke. Eventually I stopped using it and I started updating pages manually. And very quickly after that, I quit writing posts, because they were no longer being automated into&nbsp;pages.</p>
<p>It was entirely too simple to be useful, but it taught me a&nbsp;lot.</p>
<h3>Two Things I&nbsp;Learned</h3>
<p>You need to do better research before you begin a&nbsp;project.</p>
<ol>
<li>There are libs out there that will solve the problem you have already. Search for&nbsp;them.</li>
<li>There are projects out there that have extensively covered the problem you have already. Use them before trying to improve&nbsp;them.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Moving&nbsp;Forward</h3>
<p>Looking back over virulence.css: While it may have taught me to write my own <span class="caps">CSS</span> without bootstrap, it was a kind of a huge mess. The fonts were overzealous and often clashing. The spacing and general typography settings were not very professional. The colors were pretty. And that&#8217;s about what it had going for&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Moving forward, I are using <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican">Pelican</a> and <a href="https://github.com/iKevinY/pneumatic">pneumatic</a>. It&#8217;s possible that at some point I will give my own generator/theme another shot, but I won&#8217;t be doing it until I&#8217;ve got a much better understanding of how this tool works, what its failings are, and what is worth taking the time to improve about&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t start from the bottom for the sake of&nbsp;it.</h2>
<p>Unless you have some fundamental lessons to learn, there&#8217;s a better way.
That being said, there is no better way than failure to learn those fundamental&nbsp;things.</p>
