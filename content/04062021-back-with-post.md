Check out this conspiracy spamming Twitter bot I made.

## [Verif1edFacts on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Verif1edFacts)

Every hour on a cronjob it runs a simple Python script that scrapes [verifiedfacts.org](http://www.verifiedfacts.org/), which is actually a pretty old site that was making fun of this conspiracy stuff long before it got out of hand.

I like to think it presents the ideas as ridiculous as they actually are -- just regurgitated out nonsense by a program.

I can't take full credit... All I did was scrape the site and format the long articles into posts to Twittter using their API to do it. My random hash tagging of often poorly chosen words could use some improvement.

There is another feature that, after analyzing how the endpoints of [verifiedfacts.org](http://www.verifiedfacts.org/) actually work, I was able to generate articles about specific topics and not just random ones. I even have a google imaage scraper bit that grabs an image to go with it. 

But... too often these images don't work well enough to use them yet.

Here's the repo. It's pretty simple. I may or may not improve it.

At its core, it is just spamming nonsense -- what I would hope would be obvious nonsense to people, but which isn't always. Maybe its not worth improving something like this to seem more life like just for the lulz.

By the way...

I should mention that It's been about a year since I made this page and abandoned it. So today, this update comes complete with a rewrite of my [About](/about) page to explain why I feel that happened. Check that out, too.

See ya round, Internet.
