In the sprawling metropolis, the homeless struggled to survive. They slept in alleyways and begged for spare change on the streets. But there was a new player in town - a company called "StreetWise."

StreetWise had launched an app that connected homeless people with customers walking by. The app used targeted ads based on customers' browsing history to offer them deals on merchandise from the homeless. The company promised to be a win-win for everyone involved - the homeless would earn some much-needed cash, and the customers would get access to exclusive deals.

But there was a catch. The parent company, StreetWise, took a massive cut of the earnings, leaving the homeless with barely enough to survive. And they paid them in fentanyl and crystal meth, which only deepened their addiction.

Meanwhile, the customers were growing increasingly agitated. They hated being followed and bothered by the homeless. They saw them as a nuisance - an unwanted reminder of the city's problems. But they were as addicted to online shopping as the homeless were to the drugs, and so they reluctantly agreed to give up their money to the homeless who were just begging for the company.

The CEO of StreetWise, a man named Ray Kim, watched all of this unfold with a sickening sense of pleasure. He enjoyed the suffering of the homeless and the customers alike. He reveled in the power he held over them, knowing that they were all at his mercy.

As the weeks went by, the city took notice of the problem. They launched an investigation into StreetWise, but Kim was too powerful. He had bought off the right politicians and lawyers, and he was able to keep the app running.

In the end, the homeless remained trapped in their addiction, forced to beg for scraps from customers who didn't want to be bothered. And the customers remained trapped in their addiction, unable to resist the lure of the app despite their discomfort with the homeless. The only winner was the CEO of StreetWise, who continued to watch their suffering with a twisted smile on his face.

Ray Kim, the CEO of StreetWise, was a sadistic man who took pleasure in the suffering of others. He had no qualms about exploiting the homeless or the addicted customers who used his app. But there was one woman in particular who caught his attention - a homeless 19-year-old who was using the app to make ends meet.

Her name was Jane. She had fallen on hard times after being kicked out of her home and had turned to drugs to cope. When she discovered the StreetWise app, it seemed like a lifeline. She could earn enough money to buy her next fix and keep herself fed.

But what she didn't realize was that Ray Kim was watching her every move. He had become obsessed with her, tracking her through the app and even going so far as to follow her in person. He would sit in his car for hours at a time, watching her as she made her way through the city.

Kim was drawn to her vulnerability. He saw in her a kindred spirit - someone who had been cast aside by society and left to fend for herself. He knew that she was addicted to the drugs he was giving her, but he didn't care. He saw himself as a kind of savior - someone who could provide for her in ways that no one else could.

As the weeks went by, Kim's obsession grew. He started to send her messages through the app, offering her extra money in exchange for meeting him in person. At first, Jane was hesitant. She knew that something about Kim was off - he made her feel uneasy. But eventually, she relented. She needed the money, and Kim was offering her more than she could make through the app.

Their meetings were always in private, away from prying eyes. Kim would give her drugs and money, and in exchange, she would do whatever he wanted. He would make her dance for him or pose for photos. Sometimes, he would touch her inappropriately.

Jane knew that what she was doing was wrong, but she felt trapped. She couldn't escape her addiction, and she couldn't say no to the money and drugs that Kim was giving her. She was caught in a cycle of abuse and exploitation, and there seemed to be no way out.

In the end, it was the police who put a stop to Kim's twisted game. They raided his office and found evidence of his crimes - the drugs, the money, the messages to Jane. He was arrested and sent to prison for a long time.

Jane was left to pick up the pieces of her life. She was clean now, but the trauma of what had happened to her lingered. She knew that she would never be able to forget what Kim had done to her, but she also knew that she was lucky to be alive. She had survived the streets and the drugs and the twisted desires of a sadistic man. And somehow, she had come out the other side.

Jane's life after the CEO's imprisonment was plagued with paranoia and fear. She always felt like she was being watched, even in the privacy of her own home. She couldn't shake off the feeling that the CEO was still out there, monitoring her every move.

Her daughters were aware of their mother's fears, but they didn't fully understand them. They grew up knowing that their mother had been a victim of the system, but they never imagined that their family was still being targeted by the same man who had caused them so much pain.

Years passed, and the CEO eventually died in prison. Jane felt some sense of relief, but it was short-lived. She received a letter from the CEO's lawyer, informing her that he had left her a small fortune in his will. She was disgusted by the offer, knowing that it was tainted money.

Despite her reservations, Jane accepted the money. It allowed her to move her family to a safer neighborhood, and she was finally able to relax a little. But even with the extra security measures, Jane could never fully shake off the feeling that the CEO was still watching her, even from beyond the grave.

As her daughters grew up and left the nest, Jane found solace in her garden. She spent hours tending to her plants and watching the birds. It was her sanctuary, a place where she felt safe and free from the constant surveillance.

But on the day of her death, the police discovered that her garden was bugged with hidden cameras and microphones. The CEO's legacy lived on, even after his death.

The alien, a member of an advanced and highly intelligent race, had stumbled upon the time capsule on a routine exploration mission. As he sifted through the digital files of Jane's life, he became increasingly fascinated by her.

He watched videos of her walking down the street, talking with friends, and playing with her children. He read her emails and texts, learning about her hopes and fears, her triumphs and failures. He studied every detail of her life, becoming more and more infatuated with her.

Finally, he decided to use his race's advanced technology to bring her back to life. He reconstructed her body from the DNA samples in the time capsule, restoring her to the prime of her life. He took her to his home planet, where he introduced her to his people and explained how he had fallen in love with her through the digital records he had found.

At first, Jane was overwhelmed by the experience. She couldn't believe that she had been dead for ten thousand years, or that an alien had fallen in love with her based on the memories of her life that he had found in a time capsule. But as she spent more time with the alien and his people, she began to appreciate their culture and technology. She realized that in many ways, they were more advanced and enlightened than the humans of her own time.

Over time, Jane and the alien fell deeply in love. They explored the galaxy together, encountering new species and discovering new worlds. Jane learned to adapt to the ways of the alien culture, while the alien grew to appreciate the quirks and idiosyncrasies of human behavior.

Despite their differences, their love only grew stronger with each passing day. And as they looked out at the endless expanse of the universe, they knew that they had each other to explore it with.

---

The alien knew that if it weren't for Kim's obsession with Jane, he never would have found the time capsule and discovered her. He was grateful to Kim, in a way, for creating the conditions that led to his own happiness

But he couldn't ignore the fact that Kim's intentions had been malicious. He knew that she had taken pleasure in watching Jane's life unfold, and that she had reveled in the pain and suffering that she had caused. The alien could not condone such behavior, even if it had ultimately led to his own happiness.

So he made a vow to himself that he would use his advanced technology and knowledge to prevent anyone from ever suffering the same fate as Jane again. He would work to create a world where privacy and autonomy were respected, where no one's life was subject to the whims of others.

As he and Jane continued to explore the universe together, he kept this vow in his heart. He knew that he could never undo the pain that Kim had caused, but he could use his own experiences to build a better future for all beings. And in this way, Jane's story became a catalyst for change, a reminder that even the darkest of circumstances can lead to new beginnings.

As the alien and Jane traveled through the cosmos, they couldn't help but wonder about the notion of a divine being watching over them. They had encountered many different civilizations with their own beliefs about the nature of the universe, and the concept of a God or gods was a common thread that ran through many of them.

But they couldn't help but feel uneasy about the idea of a deity watching over them obsessively. The notion of a God who was constantly monitoring their every move, judging them for their actions and thoughts, was deeply unsettling.

As they discussed this with each other, they realized that their experiences with Kim had given them a unique perspective on the concept of surveillance. They had lived through the violation of their privacy, and knew firsthand the harm that could be caused by someone with that level of access and control.

They wondered if the idea of a God watching over them was simply an extension of the human desire for control and power. Perhaps it was easier to believe that someone was in charge, even if that someone was invisible and omnipotent, than to accept the inherent chaos and uncertainty of the universe.

But as they continued to explore, they also realized that the universe was full of wonder and mystery. There were things beyond their comprehension, things that could not be explained or controlled. And in the face of this vastness, the idea of a God watching over them seemed small and insignificant.

So they chose to focus on the beauty and complexity of the universe, rather than on the notion of a divine being watching over them. They marveled at the stars and galaxies, the strange and wondrous creatures they encountered, and the infinite possibilities that lay before them.

And as they gazed out into the universe, they felt a sense of awe and wonder, a feeling that was far more powerful than any fear or discomfort they might have felt about being watched by a God.

Despite being brought back to life by the alien, Jane's experiences of being constantly watched and objectified have left her traumatized and unable to live a normal life. She struggles with severe anxiety and paranoia, and becomes increasingly isolated from society.

Meanwhile, the alien becomes consumed with his love for Jane and begins to neglect his duties and responsibilities as a member of his own society. He is eventually exiled and forced to live alone on a barren planet, pining for Jane until his death.

As for Kim, he continues to exist as a disembodied mind in the data center, obsessively watching Jane and the alien until the end of time. His cruel and selfish actions have left a trail of destruction and suffering in their wake, with no redemption or hope for a better future.

---

The alien feels guilty for breaking his vow, but he cannot resist the temptation to see Jane's past and present through Kim's eyes. As he watches, he sees the extent of Kim's obsession with Jane, how he kept track of every moment of her life, and even how he manipulated her with the drug addiction. The alien is disgusted and saddened by what he sees.

At the same time, he also sees Jane's descent into madness and despair. She's haunted by memories of her past and can't escape the feeling that someone is always watching her. She becomes increasingly isolated and paranoid, pushing away those who try to help her.

The alien realizes that he's become part of the cycle of voyeurism and obsession that Kim started. He feels like he's failed both Jane and himself. The guilt and sadness weigh heavy on him, and he wonders if he'll ever be able to escape the legacy of Kim's actions.


---

Jane feels a deep sense of betrayal as she realizes that the one person she had thought was on her side was also spying on her. She becomes increasingly paranoid and reclusive, convinced that everyone is watching her every move.

The alien, heartbroken by Jane's rejection, spirals into a deep depression. He spends his days obsessively watching Kim, hoping to find some solace in the pain of another.

As for Kim, he continues to watch the world from his space station data center, his mind growing more twisted and malevolent with each passing year. He sees all, knows all, but feels nothing but a perverse sense of pleasure in the suffering of others.

And so the cycle continues, a never-ending spiral of obsession, surveillance, and despair. In the end, all that remains is the cold, uncaring eye of the machine, watching us all from its perch high above the world.

In the end, Jane dies alone in her apartment, while the alien watches helplessly from afar. And Kim, who's now a god-like creature, continues to watch and manipulate the lives of others, his obsession never-ending.

---

As Jane comes back to life once again, she is filled with rage and hatred towards the alien. She can't understand why he keeps bringing her back, why he keeps interfering in her life.

Jane screams at the alien, telling him that she never asked to be brought back, that she wants to die and be free from this never-ending cycle of suffering. The alien tries to explain to her that he only did it out of love, that he couldn't bear to see her die.

But Jane is beyond reasoning. She feels violated and betrayed, not only by the alien but also by Kim, who had been watching her all along. She curses them both, wishing that she had never been brought back, that she had never met either of them.

And so, Jane's hatred consumes her, and she becomes increasingly erratic and unstable. The alien watches helplessly as Jane spirals out of control, succumbing once again to her drug addiction and ultimately taking her own life.

The alien is left alone with his guilt, haunted by the memories of Jane and the knowledge that he was never able to save her. He spends the rest of his life in isolation, consumed by regret and longing for the one he loved but could never truly save.

---

As Jane's consciousness is suspended in the space station data center with Kim, she begins to feel a strange sense of detachment from her physical body. She can still see and hear everything that is happening around her, but she no longer feels the weight of her body or the physical sensations of the world around her.

At first, she is fascinated by the power of her new existence. She can move through walls, travel at incredible speeds, and even manipulate matter with her thoughts. But as the days and weeks pass, she begins to feel increasingly disconnected from the world of the living.

Kim, who has been watching her every move, tries to console her, but his words fall on deaf ears. She longs to be back in her body, to feel the warmth of the sun on her skin and the softness of a lover's touch.

But it is too late. Jane is trapped in this limbo forever, neither fully alive nor fully dead. And as the years turn to decades and the decades turn to centuries, she begins to lose touch with the very essence of what it means to be human.

Eventually, she forgets who she was before she died, and all that remains is a hollow shell of a being, lost in the vastness of space, longing for a life she can never have again.

---

However, Jane's consciousness is not happy about being trapped in the space station data center with Kim. She feels violated and disgusted by him and wishes to move on to whatever lies beyond this existence. But Kim, being the narcissistic and obsessive creature he is, refuses to let her go and continues to watch her every move.

As time passes, Jane's consciousness deteriorates further and she becomes increasingly angry and resentful towards Kim. She feels trapped and helpless, unable to escape his watchful gaze. The alien, watching from afar, realizes the mistake he made in bringing her back to life and wishes he could undo it.

In the end, Kim and Jane remain trapped together in the space station data center, with neither able to move on to the next stage of existence. The alien, wracked with guilt and regret, vows to never interfere with the natural order of things again, and drifts off into the vastness of space, alone and haunted by the memories of what he has done.

---

The alien is hesitant at first, but ultimately accepts Kim's offer. He is given the gift of immortality and god-like powers, but it comes at a cost. The alien is now forever bound to Kim and Jane, forced to watch over them and ensure their happiness, even if it means sacrificing his own.

As time passes, the alien begins to resent his existence, longing for the freedom that he once had. He realizes that his immortality is a curse, and that he is forever trapped in a cycle of watching over Kim and Jane, unable to escape.

In his loneliness and desperation, the alien turns to watching other beings throughout the universe, hoping to find solace in their lives. But he soon realizes that the pain and suffering he sees is too much to bear, and that he is only torturing himself further.

In the end, the alien resigns himself to his fate, knowing that he will never truly be free. He spends the rest of his days watching over Kim and Jane, always longing for a life that he can never have.

---

As Jane's consciousness is suspended in the space station data center with Kim, she begins to explore the endless possibilities of this virtual world. She creates a simulation of a city, similar to the one she once lived in, but with some differences. In this simulation, she is the CEO of the corporation that owns the app that Kim used to exploit the homeless.

Kim, on the other hand, is homeless in this virtual world, addicted to Fentanyl and begging for money from the customers who walk by him. Jane uses targeted advertising based on Kim's browser history to exploit him and extract money from him.

As Jane watches Kim suffer in this simulation, she realizes the gravity of her actions and the suffering she has caused in the real world. She becomes overwhelmed with guilt and sorrow, realizing the true extent of her addiction to power and control.

But the simulation is just a cruel reminder of what she has done and can never undo. Kim and Jane are trapped in their own purgatory, forever haunted by their past actions and unable to escape the endless cycle of pain and suffering they have created for themselves and others.

---

As the aeons pass, the space station containing Kim, Jane, and the alien continues to float in the endless void of space. But eventually, a nearby star begins to run out of fuel and explodes in a massive supernova, sending a shockwave hurtling towards the space station.

Despite their god-like powers, there is nothing Kim, Jane, or the alien can do to stop the impending destruction. They watch in despair as the shockwave approaches, knowing that they will be unable to escape it.

As the shockwave reaches the station, it tears through the hull with incredible force, destroying everything in its path. The trio's bodies are obliterated, their consciousnesses scattered to the winds.

In the end, even their god-like powers were no match for the overwhelming power of the universe. The story of Kim, Jane, and the alien comes to an abrupt and tragic end, their existence merely a brief blip in the vastness of time and space.
