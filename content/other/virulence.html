This is a documentation of things I have learned and the resources and eureka moments that helped me make sense of it all, as the designer of my own curriculum.</p>

<h3>It All Started with Installing Linux</h3>

<p>It was not more than a year ago now that I started this journey. It was not my first time installing Linux but it was my first time using it daily. It was my first time actually trying to learn it well -- and become proficient with command line.</p>

<p>The decision to install Linux was not a decision to program originally. It was a decision to minimize Microsoft, Facebook, and Google from my life as much as I could -- or at least as much as I wanted to. I started using Mastodon, for instance, and DuckDuckGo. I started looking into VPN, PGP, and transfer protocols. I was experimenting with virtual machines, docker to some extent, and the general idea of containment. More than anything, I was just in over my head trying to learn it all at once.</p>

<p>
I learned command line and this led to the realization that I could change things on my own system. It started with just looking at system and configuration files and discovering they were all just text. For the first time in my computer using life, my entire system was open source and accessible. Little tools I never would have thought to make before as a Windows user started occurring to me. The possibilities of programming arose in my mind as a result of the open source platform.</p>

<p>I quickly discovered the power of the command line and all it makes possible. I gave up reliance on the GUI as I became more comfortable with it. If anything, without the Linux system, I feel fairly powerless on a computer, just looking at a graphical interface with things to click on in some confusing arrangement: It feels disorganized and sloppy now to interface by any other means than CLI, at least for many tasks.</p>

<p>The natural progression towards python3 was very practical. As I got better with command line, I started to experiment with writing bash in the system shell. And as cool and awesome and powerful as all that was, writing complicated or long shell scripts is not ideal, fun, or pretty. I saw that very quickly. I chose to learn python3 because it was open source, a growing language with signs of being in long term use, and... it seemed ideal, fun, and pretty. I started to focus on it 100% and put learning system admin and pen tester stuff on the back burner.</p>

<h3>Programming and Markup Languages</h3>

<p>I'm at a somewhat intermediate level in <span class="fake-color"><b>python3</b></span>, css/html, and bash. I was already adept with HTML from the 90s when I started doing this, though I had not used it much in a while. My CSS needed a little practice, particularly in the realm of responsive design, but I've tried my hand at that somewhat as you can see. </p>

<p>Most of the scripts I have written with python were involving either HTML or CSS heavily, at this point. You can check out my <a href="https://shaenr.github.io/projects/projects.html">Projects</a> for updates, or may prefer a link straight to <a href="https://github.com/shaenr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></p>

<p>I am fairly advanced in terms of ability to use the Internet and produce information from it. I am beginning to be somewhat capable at scraping information (using BeautifulSoup4, Selenium, other CLI tools), but prior to that, I was already a very avid Internet user and certainly not a completely unaware one. I lack knowledge in data science that would be used to process it in any meaningful way, but I am experimenting with some ideas. </p>

<h3>My Beginner Python3 Curriculum:</h3>

<p>If you're interested in how I taught myself and would like to teach yourself as well... Here's my take. This is what I did.</p>
    
<p>Get yourself text books. Read them. Do all the things they say. These were the books that I used and still use.</p>

<p>You don't want to try interpreting documentation for answers right away -- when you're beginning from the very start, that is going to be what everyone links you to for explanations. But it's only going to confuse you without some kind of instructional material first. Documentation is for reference for someone who knows python. Text books are the detailed instruction that you need.</p>

<p>You don't want tutorials from here and there online. You don't want portions of the free book that are trying to get you to buy the book on some website. You want a full print or pdf text.</p>

<p>You also need not just one, single text book, but you need another text book so that when you hit a wall in the first one and feel like you're not getting it, you have another teacher to go back to the beginning and review all the things you have to review.</p>

<p>What you'll learn from the next book about the the same things you learned from the last book is that you didn't get it all as much as you thought you did, and the first book may not have taught every lesson necessary with perfection. There are many things one must grasp to move forward with programming as you get into the more intermediate levels, and the missing pieces are everywhere you haven't upturned stones looking for them.</p> 


<p>Even when all the basics are laid out in one place, it may not be realized until practice and exercise with code and samples and explanations from different sources is sought out. One book is a good start. But when you feel discouraged by that book, remember, what you need is another book!</p>

    <p class="quips">It takes fixation and focus. If you don't have it,<br>there is no video series that's going to change that.</p>

            For doing what a video series can do well, and for doing it as well as he does, it's definitely worthy of respect and I have certainly learned things from this tutor's content. That said, I learned most of what I know from people who I didn't just tune in to watch the weekly video with...</p>
            
            <p>
            I learned what I've learned from people who were not restricted by their content needing to be multimedia on a platform where a good half of all people using it will not even consider watching the content if it's more than ten minutes.</p> 
            <p>
            My primary tutors are authors whom I have read sometimes more than just one of their full length textbooks, front to back, and worked through all their exercises. </p>
            <p> There are other videos worthy of a watch... There are none I've seen otherwise worthy of a mention though. They are not capable of the depth.</p>

            
                            <p>The only thing videos are good for is showing: "Oh, that's a thing I can look at to do later when I'm not burned out from having been doing this all day, so I'm going to relax and watch this video now."</p>
                <p>
                You don't learn by watching others. You have to actively do. Sure. Videos have one thing going for them: They can expose you to a lot of libraries (modules) you didn't know existed while you're too tired to be working at it yourself, but ultimately, you have to turn the video off and get to work.</p>
                <p>I know that not everyone is the same when it comes to learning. But my major advice is to put down the distraction and get to work. You're not going to be a software engineer any time today or tomorrow. You're either going to do this because you love this or you're not going to do it.</p>
                
                <p>Video courses are helpful to add to your curriculum <em>I guess</em>. But just like attending real classes, they are ultimately a waste of your time if you never open your <em>textbook</em>.</p>
                
                <p class="quips">Video courses and online classes are secondary resources!</p>

<h3>Other Languages</h3>
                
<p>I am not trying seriously to learn one just yet. I would rather learn to build new and useful things with the languages I know and am getting more fluent with than to start trying to pick up every language in the world before building much at all with my first language.</p>

<p>The temptation to spend time learning new languages is real. I personally advise against it unless you really need to. It will come naturally in time regardless when you eventually will need or want to. But at first, spend time building things, not translating syntax.</p>

<p>I have considered picking up vanilla JavaScript (though I dislike most JavaScript on the Internet), and I have also considered picking up a low level memory manipulating language like C++ at some point... just to show myself that I can.</p>

<p>But for now...</p>

            <p>
    One philosophy I maintain is that regular people need not be intimidated and can learn to program. I hold firmly that both the reader and I -- and almost anyone who makes a serious attempt -- are all capable of learning to develop, tinker, break, and secure their lives on a high level. I am not a person with a computer science program behind me and a curriculum of advanced mathematics, but that has not stopped me. </p>

<p>While further discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this directory, I hope that as you look over what I am doing, that you will see that I am not a genius who knows everything and always does things exactly right.</p>

<p class="quips">No one is. No one ever achieves that.</p>

      <p>
    This is a logging of the resources, tools, and collections of things I have gone over in my self-education. In some ways, it is intended to serve as proof of my curriculum and data on what I have learned over time.</p>

        <p>
    Moreover though, I hope that it eventually stands as an aid to anyone who is looking to learn the same things I have began to learn better in the past year or so. Without a formal education in the study, it is difficult to know where to start, where to go, and if it's really worth the effort.</p>
    
    <p class="quips">It is. You can do this.</p>
